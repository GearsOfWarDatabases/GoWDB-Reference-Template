rem Starts Jekyll from the real site root - walks UP from wherever this
rem .bat lives until it finds _config.yml, however many levels that takes,
rem instead of only checking one level up. That one-level check is how
rem this got run from inside ref/ before (with no _config.yml there),
rem which is exactly how ref/_site ended up full of copied screenshot
rem folders and stray .bat files - Jekyll happily builds from cwd with
rem default settings when it can't find a config, it just silently builds
rem the wrong folder instead of erroring.

rem A stale PATH in whatever launched this window is the #1 reason
rem "Last updated" silently falls back to build time instead of the real
rem git commit time (see _plugins/last_commit.rb) - print what THIS
rem window actually resolves, so that's visible instead of silent:
echo Checking git/ruby/bundle on PATH for this window:
where git
where ruby
where bundle
echo.

rem Write the real last-git-commit info (time, short hash, branch) to
rem _data\last_commit.yml before every local serve. _plugins\last_commit.rb
rem does the equivalent git calls from inside Jekyll itself (meant to work
rem the same way locally and in CI/production) but on this machine
rem specifically, Jekyll's plugin loader never actually runs anything in
rem _plugins\ under the real `jekyll` CLI (confirmed directly - a plain
rem top-level print statement in that file never fires under `jekyll
rem build`/`serve` here, even though the exact same file loads fine when
rem Jekyll is driven from a plain Ruby script instead of the CLI - root
rem cause not fully pinned down, `where` output above is one more data
rem point toward it). This batch-level fallback sidesteps the whole
rem mystery, so it's what actually drives the header banner locally.
rem _data\last_commit.yml is gitignored - never committed - so production/
rem CI (no start-jekyll.bat step there) just falls back to the plugin's own
rem values instead, where they aren't known to be broken. See
rem _includes/header.html for the fallback chain (this data file -> the
rem plugin's values -> build time, in that order).

rem Host OS tag (see _plugins/last_commit.rb's host_os_tag for the full
rem explanation - inspired by AzerothCore's own revision-line platform tag,
rem but named "Windows"/"Mac"/"Unix" rather than AC's literal Win64/Win32/
rem Unix, since the 32-vs-64-bit distinction isn't a meaningful detail for
rem a static site). This .bat only ever runs on Windows, so it's just the
rem literal string - set here (not hardcoded below) purely so it sits right
rem next to the git calls above as the obvious Windows-side counterpart to
rem the Ruby plugin's own version. Computed unconditionally, same reasoning
rem as the plugin: AzerothCore's platform tag isn't gated on git
rem succeeding, so this shouldn't be either.

rem "Uptime" in the banner counts from THIS moment - when this server
rem actually started - not from the commit time above (those are two
rem different things: how fresh the displayed revision is vs. how long

rem %date%/%time% because those are locale-formatted and unreliable to
rem parse; ToString with an explicit format is locale-independent and
rem already ISO 8601 with a numeric UTC offset, same as git's %%cI above.
rem Run via `start /min /wait` into its OWN separate console, and have
rem PowerShell itself write the result straight to a temp file (Out-File),
rem rather than piping it inline through `for /f` like the git calls
rem above - piping keeps everything in THIS window's shared console, and
rem powershell.exe applies its own registered font/size to whatever
rem console it attaches to, which was visibly resizing/refonting this
rem window mid-run. A separate console confines that to itself instead.
